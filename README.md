# An introduction to OOP in Python

Some time ago I gave a seminar in which I introduced the basic ideas of object oriented
programming and explain how to apply them when writing code in Python. This repository
contains the Jupyter notebook that I prepared for the seminar. 

Even though it was conceived as material for the seminar, I tried to write in a way such that it can also be used on its own. The concepts covered in the seminar are explained
in markdown cells and the examples are also explain using comments and markdown cells.

## Topics covered

* What a programming paradigm is.

* The main ideas of object oriented programming.

* The difference between objects and classes and how to define them in Python.

* How to add methods to a class and how to call the methods of an object.

* What magic methods are.

* The concept of encapsulation and how in Python is based on convention.

* How to work with attributes.

* What Inheritance is and how to use it.

Then a small example based on Bingo! is included to show how this ideas can be applied in a concrete problem. After that some more advance ides that can be useful are introduced:

* Setter and Getters

* Class methods

* Dataclasses

* Immutable and hashable objects
