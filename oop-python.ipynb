    "\n",
    "A way of thinking about programming paradigms is by understanding how a programming\n",
    "problem is solved. Broadly speaking, it requires two steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. First, the problem must be examined and expressed using concepts that a computer can\n",
    "understand. A solution can be found and expressed in these same concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Only then the solution to the problem can be implemented in a specific programming\n",
    "language. Each programming language offers a different set of features.\n",
    "\n",
    "These two steps are not completely independent, ideally the concepts used to describe\n",
    "the problem in 1 should align as much as possible with the features of the programing\n",
    "language chosen in 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "Programming paradigm is the name given to these set of features and/or concepts that are\n",
    "used to express a problem and its solution in a way that a computer can understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "So far we have been writing our programs mainly using variables, functions, control flow\n",
    "statements (if, elif, else) and loops. These features correspond to a paradigm called\n",
    "procedural programming.\n",
    "\n",

    "Variables inside objects are called **attributes** or fields (in Python they are called\n",
    "attributes) and functions inside objects are called **methods**.\n",

    "called any number of times with any number of arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, to use objects in Python, we first need to define it's behavior and then we\n",
    "can use this definition to create as many objects as we want. \n",
    "\n",
    "The definition that contains the behavior of a type of object is called a class. Usually\n",
    "it is used to specify the methods (functions) and attributes (variables) that will be\n",
    "contained in all the objects of that type.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the class is defined, it can be used as a template to create objects. This objects\n",
    "will be of the same type but can, for example, have different values for their properties.\n",
    "Think, for example, about how different lists can contain different values, even though\n",
    "they are all lists.\n",

    "We have seen how in OOP systems are built by creating objects and making them interact,\n",
    "encapsulation is about limiting what objects can be seen from outside an object.\n",
    "In other words, we care about *what* an object does, but not about *how* it does it.\n",
    "Traditionally, OOP states that objects must hide their internal behavior, exposing\n",
    "only a few methods for other objects to see.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other programming languages that support OOP implement encapsulation but distinguishing\n",
    "between public and private methods. Public elements can be seen by other objects, whereas\n",
    "private elements cannot. Attributes are then accessed though public methods. For each\n",
    "attribute there are two public methods: a setter and a getter. The getter is used to\n",
    "obtain te value of the attribute and the setter is used to change the value of the attribute.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python uses a different approach. In python everything is public, there are no private\n",
    "methods and attributes can be accessed directly. Encapsulation is the achieved by \n",
    "using certain conventions to show what shouldn't be accessed. This is, the language doesn't\n",
    "enforce encapsulation, the programmer can show what methods and attributes are *intended*\n",

    "> “Private” instance variables that cannot be accessed except from inside an object don’t exist in Python. However, there is a convention that is followed by most Python code: a name prefixed with an underscore (e.g. _spam) should be treated as a non-public part of the API (whether it is a function, a method or a data member). It should be considered an implementation detail and subject to change without notice.\n"
